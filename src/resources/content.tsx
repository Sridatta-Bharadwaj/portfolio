      <>
        I am a student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Chennai campus, with a strong interest in computer science, algorithms, and building a solid conceptual foundation in technology. I enjoy problem-solving, breaking down complex ideas into simple explanations, and presenting technical concepts clearly through code and visuals. My work spans programming, algorithm analysis, statistics, and technical presentations, with a focus on clarity, consistency, and continuous learning. I am actively exploring tools, technologies, and ideas that bridge theory with practical application.
